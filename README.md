# Scraped-website-using-Scrapy

I used Scrapy to scrape the website (Uses sitemap to crawl). This crawl product names, prices, and ratings from it.

The name of the website is noon.com which I crawled and I saved all the required data into .csv file automatically.

Some products are having ratings and some do not. Those products which don't have a rating that block is empty.
